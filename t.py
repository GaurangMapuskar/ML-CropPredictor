The pH of soil should be 6.5 to 7.5 and EC of water should be less than 1.0. Plant is highly sensitive to water-logged soils. A dry climate with about 50-75 cm of rainfall from June-September and with well defined summer and winter season is ideal.\n\n Sweet orange can be grown even upto an elevation of 900m above mean sea level. The extreme of temperature are necessary for achieving higher yield. Temperature 25Â°C is most ideal and extreme cold and high temperatures are determinate.")
